**Story of the Data**

This dataset represents real individuals and the health factors that shape their risk of experiencing a stroke. As I analyzed variables like age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose levels, BMI, and smoking status, clear patterns began to appear. Older adults and those with medical conditions showed higher vulnerability, while lifestyle choices also played a role. By categorizing key metrics and using Excel to clean, visualize, and interpret the information, the dataset revealed how different factors combine to influence stroke risk. Ultimately, the data tells a simple but important story: stroke is not random, and understanding these patterns can help support awareness and prevention.

**Methodology**

The dataset was cleaned to remove duplicates, correct errors, and handle missing values, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Key transformations included creating Age_Group, BMI_Category, Glucose_Level_Category, Chronic_Condition_Flag, and Risk_Label to enhance interpretability. For analysis, stroke was set as the dependent variable, while demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and biometric measures served as independent variables. The dataset was also split into groups based on stroke occurrence, risk level, and age. Belonging to the healthcare industry, these insights help stakeholders, such as hospitals, public health agencies, and researchers, identify high-risk populations, improve early detection, and guide preventive strategies.

**Pre-Analysis**

Preliminary exploration of the dataset revealed early trends: stroke incidence increases with age, and individuals with hypertension, heart disease, high BMI, or elevated glucose levels are more affected. Early correlations suggest that age, chronic conditions, and lifestyle factors interact to influence stroke risk. These initial insights highlight key variables to investigate further and help identify high-risk groups for targeted interventions.

**In-Analysis**

Deep analysis of the dataset revealed that stroke risk is higher in individuals with both hypertension and heart disease, older adults, those with high BMI, elevated glucose levels, and smoking habits. Preliminary recommendations include prioritizing preventive care for high-risk groups, promoting lifestyle interventions, and raising public awareness. Excel tools like pivot tables, conditional formatting, and charts were used to identify patterns and visualize insights effectively.

**Post-Analysis Insights**

The analysis confirmed that stroke risk is highest among older adults, especially those with hypertension and heart disease. High BMI, elevated glucose levels, and smoking further increase vulnerability. The findings largely supported initial observations, with some patterns like the combined impact of hypertension and heart disease being stronger than expected. These insights highlight the importance of targeted preventive care, lifestyle interventions, and public health strategies to reduce stroke incidence.

**Data Visualizations**

Visualizations in Excel were used to highlight stroke risk patterns and make insights accessible. The histogram chart showed Age Demographics of Stroke Occurrence, the column charts illustrated BMI Category Distribution and Stroke Prevalence across Smoke Status, the sunburst chart showed Proportion of Stroke and Non-Stroke Cases by Gender, the pie chart showed Stroke Prevalence across Glucose Level Category, and the bar chart showed Stroke Prevalence across Glucose Level Category. A consolidated dashboard provided stakeholders with a quick overview of high-risk groups and key trends, supporting informed healthcare decisions.

**Recommendations**

The analysis highlights the need to focus on high-risk groups, including older adults and individuals with hypertension, heart disease, high BMI, or elevated glucose levels. Preventive measures such as lifestyle interventions, smoking cessation, and public awareness campaigns are recommended. Resource allocation and risk stratification models can help healthcare stakeholders optimize care. Notably, the combined effect of multiple chronic conditions was stronger than expected, and some younger adults also showed increased risk, emphasizing the need for broad preventive strategies.

**Conclusion**

The analysis confirmed that stroke risk is strongly linked to age, hypertension, heart disease, high BMI, elevated glucose levels, and smoking. Multiple chronic conditions further increase vulnerability, while lifestyle factors affect even younger adults. Limitations include missing data, a lack of some health variables, and the cross-sectional nature of the dataset. Future research could incorporate additional health metrics, predictive modeling, and longitudinal data to improve risk assessment and preventive strategies.
